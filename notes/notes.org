PLAYERS
  - Number of players     : 9

CURRENCY
  - Initial currency      : 100,000 pearls (There should be enough money. check and change this later.)
  - Distance to travel    : 100kms

TRAVEL
  - Travel rate           : 10km per hour
  - Total time for travel : 10 hours

ENERGY
  - Energy required to travel for 1km                        : 2 Energy Units (EU)
  - Energy required to travel for 10kms                      : 20 EU
  - Energy required to travel for total travel 100kms        : 200 EU.
  - Total energy required per hour for all players per hours : 20 x 9 = 180 EU

MARKET
  - Number of markets : 3 = R, G, B
  - Schedule for each market per hour : 180 EU/3 = Expected to sell 60 EU.
  - Starting EU price : 50 pearls.

Variables in equation
  - p0 = target price = 50 pearls
  - k = decay rate with no purchases (or with less than schedule) = 10%
  - f(t) = issuance schedule = 60 EU per hour = 60(t)

Logic and requirements
  - market id needs to be stored too since 3 markets are involved.
  - quantity sold so far need to be tracked too.
  - Change the logic to say that players have to buy EU to start travelling.
    - No. This will not work out. Let them have some energy already to start travelling.
  - At any hour, check the number of EU ordered. If less than the required rate, decrease the price, or else increase the price.
  - So, one of the inputs of the purchase price function is the quantity of EU requested.
  - So, at the first hour, 180 EU should have been sold by each market.

Design
1. List of all enrolled players identified by their account address.
   - Initial balance: 50000 pearls.
   - Keep track of energy units bought every hour.
   - 2D structure. players vs pearls spent every hour.

2. Market datastore.
   - Identifier - R-G-B or 1-2-3.
   - Units sold till now
   - demand for this round.
   - last calculated price
   - round number.


Functions:
 1. execute round(round number).

Game State - status of the current game - Ignore for now.
 - Start - 
 - Finish - 

Market - Getter - Price for the last round.
